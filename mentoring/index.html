One of the more daunting things we encounter in open source development is
getting enough people to regularly contribute. To be sustainable, we need to
encourage new contributors to participate. To that end, we seek to engage new
contributors and experienced developers alike to participate in mentoring.
Mentoring provides participants with direction and encouragement to help them
find their way. This session is for anyone who would like to learn more about
the Drupal mentoring program, mentoring in open source in general, how to mentor
new contributors, or how to organize their own sprints. We will cover tools
available to mentors, documentation, and practical techniques for mentoring
newcomers. We will include strategies for how to: * Make sure people feel
welcome * Match tasks to participants * Keep people engaged even when they
struggle * Help without being overbearing * Answer questions even if you do
not know the answer * Enable folks to continue afterward on their own.

    <h2>Where do mentors come from?</h2>
    <h3>Engage new contributors and experienced developers
        <br>alike to participate in mentoring</h3>
    <aside class="notes">
        That is how mentors can help bring in people to participate,
        and become repeat participants.
        But where do the mentors come from?
        This is one of the keys to mentoring in public.
        Experienced contributors will see the mentor interactions
        and reuse those patterns themselves when helping people.
        They can also see what mentors really do, and will see they
        can be a mentor. (Dont have to know answers to questions,
        only share how to find answers.)
        Ask in advance for mentors, explain the "qualifications"
        (minimal qualifications and there will be support for mentors).
        Explain the expectations.
        Ask in a pinch. If someone has done a task a few times,
        and a new person wants help doing it, ask that experienced person to help.
        Now they are a mentor.

    <h2>Support mentors</h2>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>instead of doing this for tasks the participants do,

            <li>be available for questions</li>

        <ul>
            <li>document repetitive things mentors explain
            <br>this makes a mentor memory so new mentors know
            <br>and can be shared directly with participants so they dont have to ask mentors
            <br>Contributor Task Documents.</li>

    <h2>Sprints</h2>
    <aside class="notes">
        Sprints are usually in person focused events,
        with realtime interactions, lasting all day.
        Sometimes people participate remotely (drupal uses irc often for remote interactions).
        Drupal Global Sprint Weekend is small local sprints all over the world Jan 25 and 26 2014.

        Take pictures.
        Publish!
        <br>Identify tasks that can result in a first time something.
